Site Name: Translation Converter

Description:

The Translation Converter is a simple web-based tool that allows users to easily convert a block of text in one language into HTML format with corresponding translations. This tool is particularly useful for content creators, web developers, or anyone who needs to create bilingual content with sequential numbering.

Key Features:

Input Both Languages: The site provides two separate text input boxes, one for the source language (e.g., English) and the other for the target language (e.g., Portuguese). Users can input text in both languages line by line.

Sequential Numbering: The Translation Converter automatically adds sequential numbering to each pair of lines, ensuring that the HTML output maintains the original order of the text.

Output HTML Code: Upon clicking the "Convert" button, the site generates HTML code with the specified formatting, including <tr> and <td> tags. Users can easily copy and paste this HTML code into their web projects.

Validation: The tool checks for empty lines and ensures that the number of lines in both languages matches before generating HTML code.

Usage:

Enter the text in the source language (e.g., English) into the "English Text" textarea.

Enter the corresponding translation in the target language (e.g., Portuguese) into the "Portuguese Translation" textarea.

Click the "Convert" button to generate the HTML code.

Copy the generated HTML code and paste it into your HTML document to display the bilingual content.

The Translation Converter simplifies the process of creating bilingual content with proper HTML formatting, making it an essential tool for those working on multilingual websites or documents.
